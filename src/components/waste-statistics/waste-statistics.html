		<h2>Plastic waste facts & figs</h2>

		<p><em>20.000.000</em> kg of waste is spilt into the North Sea each year, most of which is plastic. Plastic does not break down biologically but breaks up into ever smaller pieces and accumulates in our marine environment. Plastic has permeated / infiltrated every level of our food chain and we are now finding in supermarket fish and our dinnerplates. Plastic production has increased <em>20 fold</em> within the last 40 years. <em>100.000 sea mammals and 1 million sea birds</em> die worldwide as a result of marine plastic debris. <em>94%</em> of the plastic waste sinks (further slowing down the degradation process.). <em>40.000</em> kilos of waste wash down the river rhine each year - most of which are single use plastics. On average <em>2000kg</em> of plastic waste is found on every square kilometer of beach worldwide.</p>
