            The iconic rivers the Seine and the Rhine are chosen as start and finish because of their role in the transportation of plastic waste from inland sources; emphasizing ‘Plastic Soup’ is not an abstract problem but is tangible and starts as litter in your own back yard. The finish in The Hague coincides with <a href='https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/2018/07/grootste-opruimactie-ooit-in-nederland/'>World Clean Up Day</a> on 15th of September which fully supports his key message.
