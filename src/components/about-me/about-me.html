    <p>Merijn Tinga (44y) learns to windsurf when he is eight years old. He graduates in Biology at Leiden University in '96. Looking for an new challenge he quits his job four years later and cycles to Morocco - and back - with a kitesurf board. Once on the Moroccan beaches he decides he wants to become a visual artist.</p>

    <p>Starting with guerrilla art he gains regional fame with his art-collective (Kunst Uitschot Team) by illegally installing their wooden sculptures in public space â€“ a few sculptures can still be found in the public parks of Leiden. In his studio he makes installations and sculptures for the public space and festivals.</p>

    <p>In 2013 he is alarmed by the first reports on the 'plastic soup' in our oceans. He combines his urge for adventure, his art skills and his surfing experience in the construction of the first Plastic Soup Board from plastic litter he finds on his local beach. After his first expedition on this Plastic Soup Board his focus shifts entirely to the marine litter problem. In 2015 and 2016 he conducts two other projects on the prevention of plastic waste in our marine environment.</p>
