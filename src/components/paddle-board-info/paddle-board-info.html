		<h2>The Plastic Soup SUP</h2>

		<p>The Stand Up Paddle (SUP) board was built in collaboration with an Industrial Designer from the Science Centre at the Delft Technical University. Five thousand bottle caps and over a hundred small littered plastic bottles were used in the design. The board was constructed using the latest innovations in eco design. Moreover, it was designed in such a way that it could hold all the luggage needed to be self-sufficient during the expedition.</p>
