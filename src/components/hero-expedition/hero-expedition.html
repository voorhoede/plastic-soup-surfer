			<h2 class="title">The Plastic Soup Surfer</h2>

			<p class="text">The Plastic Soup Surfer's mission is to stop the increasing plastic pollution of the marine environment. His campaigns are aimed at preventing plastic litter in the first place. The surfboard he will use for this journey is made from plastic litter and is a statement by itself. It is on this board that the Plastic Soup Surfer will paddle down the Rhine in 28 days.</p>

			<p class="text">In #Source2Sea the Plastic Soup Surfer wants to show how much plastic litter is found along the Rhine and demonstrate that this litter will eventually wash out to sea; and be lost forever. He will focus on the sources of riverine plastic litter and will hold accountable the companies that produced the plastic products littered by sending these companies a warrant.</p>

			<p class="text">He calls out to you to help address te chief executives of the plastic producing an packaging companies by sending them a warrant. Because we need a change!</p>
