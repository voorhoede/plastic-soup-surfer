    <p>Merijn Tinga is a biologist. He turned his back on biology in 2000 when he decided to cycle to Marocco (and back) with a kitesurfboard behind his bicycle. Once on the Maroccan beaches he decided to ‘become’ a visual artist.</p>

    <p>In his studio he makes installations and sculptures for the public space and festivals. He gained regional fame with his art-collective (Kunst Uitschot Team) through the illegal placings of their sculptures – many of which can still be admired in the public parks of Leiden. In 2009 he sailed around Great Brittain for a photography project – a camera in the mast of their ship took interval photos during the whole circumnavigation. After having built the Plastic Soup Board he has become focussed on Marine Litter. In 2015 he sailed round Scandinavie – hunting for plastic. And at the moment he is preparing a record Norht Sea crossing on a board the shape of a Soda Bottle.</p>
